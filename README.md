ðŸš‘ Healthcare Dashboard Overview ðŸ©º

I'm excited to share a snapshot of a dynamic Healthcare Dashboard I recently worked on. This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key healthcare metrics, enabling quick and effective decision-making. Here are some of the key features:

Interactive Filters: Users can easily select specific months and years to customize the data view, ensuring the most relevant insights are displayed.
Medical Condition Analysis: A detailed pie chart, enhanced with checkboxes, allows users to filter and view patient numbers based on their medical conditions (Abnormal, Inconclusive, and Normal). This feature provides a clear and customizable visual of overall patient health.
Disease Distribution: Line charts illustrate the number of patients by different diseases such as Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, and more, helping to identify trends and areas of concern.
Gender Distribution: A gender distribution donut chart provides a quick look at the patient demographic split, essential for gender-focused health initiatives.
Patient Admissions: A bar chart shows the types of patient admissions (Elective, Emergency, and Urgent), highlighting the healthcare system's demand areas.
Blood Group Breakdown: A pie chart visualizes the distribution of patients by blood group, which can be vital for blood donation drives and related healthcare services.
Monthly Patient Trends: This section provides an in-depth look at patient numbers by disease across different months, helping track seasonal trends or spikes in specific conditions.
This dashboard is an excellent tool for healthcare professionals looking to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.
